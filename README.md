# CM0440: Linear Systems

This repository implements the SEIRS model to simulate the spread of an infectious disease. It divides the population into compartments for susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and those who lose immunity (susceptible again). You can customize parameters like transmission rate and recovery rate to fit your scenario. The included script defines the model, while an optional script demonstrates running simulations and visualizing the results over time. This code requires MATLAB and the ODE solver.
